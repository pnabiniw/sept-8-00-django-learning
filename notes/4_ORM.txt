1. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping
2. It is a way to query the database without using the raw query.
3. Rather than using a raw query, python object is used to query the database.

4. If 'Student' is a table in a django project, then we can use following ORM to get
all the students of the table.
    students = Student.objects.all()  # ORM
    print(students)

    Here "Student.objects.all()" is an ORM to get all the students. It's
    equivalent raw query is "SELECT * FROM STUDENT"
