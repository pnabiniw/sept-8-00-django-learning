There are three types of Model Relations
    - One-to-One Relation
    - One-to-Many Relation
    - Many-to-Many Relation

1. One-to-One Relation
    => In one-one relation, relations are maintained uniquely.
    If Student is a model and StudentProfile is the model with one-one relation
    with Student table then, "student_id" is unique in the StudentProfile table.
    Following are the related ORMs

    i) StudentProfile.objects.create(roll_no=2, contact=989890988, student_id=1)
    ii) student = Student.objects.get(id=2)
        StudentProfile.objects.create(roll_no=1, contact=989098998, student=student)

    iii) sp = StudentProfile.objects.get(id=2)
         print(sp.contact)
         print(sp.roll)
         print(sp.student.name)
         print(sp.student.age)
         print(sp.student.email)

    iv) StudentProfile.objects.filter(roll_no=2, student__name="Jon")
    v)  sp = StudentProfile.objects.get(id=2)
        student = sp.student
        student.name = "Ram"
        student.age = 40
        student.save()

    v) sp = StudentProfile.objects.get(id=2)
       student = sp.student
       student.delete()
